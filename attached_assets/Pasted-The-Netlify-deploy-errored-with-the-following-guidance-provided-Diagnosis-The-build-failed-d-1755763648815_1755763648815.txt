The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to an error in resolving the dependency "@netlify/functions/express" in the file "api.js".

**Solution:**
1. Verify if the package "@netlify/functions/express" is present in the top-level "package.json" file of the site's dependencies.

2. If the package is not in the "package.json" file, add it as a dependency by running the following command in the project directory:
   ```bash
   npm install @netlify/functions-express
   ```

3. If the package is not intended to be bundled, mark the path "@netlify/functions/express" as external to exclude it from the bundle. Update the build configuration to mark it as external.

4. After making the necessary changes, trigger a new build to see if the issue is resolved.
