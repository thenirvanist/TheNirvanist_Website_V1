The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to a warning related to the CommonJS "module" variable being treated as a global variable in an ECMAScript module. This is caused by the file `netlify/functions/api.js` using `module.exports.handler` in an ECMAScript module when the `package.json` file sets the type to "module". This conflict is causing the function creation to fail.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, you need to rename the `api.js` file to use the `.cjs` file extension. In the Vite project configuration, CommonJS files in a "type": "module" package are required to use the `.cjs` file extension. First, ensure that the `api.js` file is present in the repository. Then, rename `api.js` to `api.cjs`.

After renaming the file, the build should be successful without the ECMAScript module warning.
